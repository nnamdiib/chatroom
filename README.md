Chatroom service i am trying to build using Tornado and Bootstrap. A good portion of the code is from jPablo128's helpful tutorial on http://www.jpablo128.com/multi-room-websockets-server-with-tornado-i-basic-chat-server/ 

I will extend his idea by adding the following features:

- Message persistence
	- Pickles?
	- How to accurately sort each chat session by room name and time?
	- Some combination of a small db + json data + time stamp?
	

- Attractive UI (done)
	- Homepage (done)
	- Existing chatroom page (done)
	- Chat page (done)

- limit usernames to 15 chars (done)

- no spaces allowed in room and usernames. (done)

- Show available chatrooms(done)
