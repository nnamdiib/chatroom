Chatroom service i am trying to build using Tornado and Bootstrap. A good portion of the code is from jPablo128's helpful tutorial on http://www.jpablo128.com/multi-room-websockets-server-with-tornado-i-basic-chat-server/ 

I will extend his idea by adding the following features:

- Message persistence

- Attractive UI

- limit usernames to 15 chars

- Show available chatrooms
