Chatroom service i am trying to build using Tornado and Bootstrap. A good portion of the code is from jPablo128's helpful tutorial on http://www.jpablo128.com/multi-room-websockets-server-with-tornado-i-basic-chat-server/ 

I will extend his idea by adding the following features:

- Message persistence
	- I am using a simple db with one table that stores all sent messages. 
	- Retrieval can be through room name + time
	- I can't think of a simpler way to get this done.
	

- Attractive UI (done)
	- Homepage (done)
	- Existing chatroom page (done)
	- Chat page (done)

- no spaces allowed in room and usernames. (done)

- Show available chatrooms(done)
